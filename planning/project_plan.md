# Project Plan

Pod Members: Abdullah Saleh, Amantina Rossi, Hawo Issa

## Problem Statement and Description

Problem Statement:
2-4 years in college fly by. College students struggle to go outside of their bubbles and explore all the social possibilities during their time in school, especially when faced with mountains of information about different opportunities at their college.

Description:
The purpose of our project is to provide college students with a way to organize and prioritize all of the events, locations, clubs, experiences, and more that they may want to explore and try. Our website's main feature would be a bucket list creator that allows students to include custom entries to populate their running bucket lists, as well as check off items once they've been accomplished. Each entry can include details such as category, location, date, and cost. Additionally, students using our website will be able to view a global list of entries from other users to gain inspiration for their own lists.

## User Roles and Personas

1. Kowsar Senn is a senior at MIT studying Computer Science. Kowsar realizes she spent the last years in college prioritizing school/assignments and barely made any memories with friends outside of the classroom. She decided she will make the most out of her last year but is struggling to find activities and a community of students with similar goals as her. 
2. Afnaan Adventurous is a college freshman at Stanford University who is excited to make the most out of his college experience at his dream school. After attending his school's new student orientation, he was left feeling overwhelmed with the mountain of resources offered to him about clubs, sporting events, networking opportunities, greek life, school traditions and more. He knows he wants to try as much as possible, but doesn’t quite know where to start.
