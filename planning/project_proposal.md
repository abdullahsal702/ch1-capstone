## Problem Statement

2-4 years in college fly by. College students struggle to push their bubbles and explore all the social possibilities during their time in school. 

## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?

The purpose of our project is to provide college students with a way to organize and prioritize all of the events, locations, clubs, experiences, and more that they may want to explore and try. Our website's main feature would be a bucket list creator that allows students to include custom entries to populate their running bucket list, as well as check off items once they've been accomplished. Each entry can include details such as XXX. Additionally, students using our website will be able to share their lists with others and see what's on other's bucket lists so they can be inspired to continue adding to their own. Users will create a profile and __. 

## Expected Features List

- User profile with login/register
- Profile to display bucket lists
- Edit and Create functionality to add to bucket lists and create new ones 
- One way following between users
- Data visualization of bucket list accomplishments over time
- Reminders and deadlines for bucket list items
- Customizable bucket list items to include details such as cost, priority, category, etc.

## Related Work

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?

There are plenty of college bucket list articles on the internet, but no tools for college students to organize and prioritize the things they actually want to do. Other list or note taking websites don't focus in on this act of intentionally listing out the various activities a student aims to engage in during their time in college. Additionally, our website will combine features like budget consciousness and data analysis/visualization to help students reflect on how they are spending their time and money in school. 

## Open Questions

What questions do you still have? What topics do you need to research more for your project?

We are still needing to figure out what features will fit within the scope of our timeline and skillset. We need to continue our research and practice with advanced database and SQL skills. We also need to learn how to execute socio-technical system features such as following or favoriting other users/user content.
