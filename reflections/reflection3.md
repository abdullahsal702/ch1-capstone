## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Implemented some stretch features - badges, user addition to gallery, advanced search in gallery 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

We had some challenges outlining and getting our social stretch features to work, but were able to figure things out by debugging together. We also consulted with some members of other groups. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We fiinshed all our tasks for this sprint this week. We planned this week a little differently as we added things throughout the week to meet various stretch features. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

One important resource we used were other interns from other groups. We consulted with another group about our advanced search feature. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Currently, deploying the backend and frontend of the website posed a risk as the backend was not properly working once deployed. For Week 10, we'll have to debug and figure out why the backend isn't properly being represented in Heroku.
