## Reflection Questions

Name at least one successful thing this week.

- Completed MVP
- Started Stretch features
- Solid Demo

What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

- challenge with user queries/backend
- figuring out price formating
- getting up to speed with tailwind css
- work fatigue

Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

- yes we did!

Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

- Obi and our mentors were great resources in cleaning up our UI

Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

- user items being added to the gallery, it is proving to be a bit complex
- some of our other stretch features might not get done. We will focus on one stretch feature at a time and just get as much as we can done.
