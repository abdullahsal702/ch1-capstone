## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 - Finishing sprint 1
 - 100% of the MVP backend complete
 - Implemented 3rd party libraries (emoji picker!!)
 - Front end looking good
 - Great progress given the challenges we faced in the last few weeks

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 - Merge Conflicts/Git commands
 - Abdullah being out for a week, other absences 
 - Re-prioritizing features for MVP

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 -Yes, we finished all of our tasks for our sprint 1 plan

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 - Past labs and Jeff Astor videos were helpful in setting up the backend
 - Planning materials like the wireframes, data models table, endpoint table, and user stories helped us keep track of everything we needed to implement
 - Github Project Board help us break down the work into manageble pieces
 - Mentor Meetings were great for getting feedback
 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 - Social features on our stretch feature list might not be able to be completed depending on our progress. We are going to try to implement a one way user following system and prioritize the main functionality of the app before we try to add the stretch feature.
